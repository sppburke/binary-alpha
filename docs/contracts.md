# System contracts

These contracts bind every phase of Binary Alpha. The current checkout implements only the
[configuration](#configuration) section; the other sections are frozen now so that later phases
implement them once, in one place, without reinterpretation. Specification intent, checkout
implementation, observed runtime state, immutable measured artifacts, and hosted Git state are
distinct kinds of truth and are never substituted for one another.

## Time

Seven clocks are distinct. A record names which clock each timestamp carries; no field is
"the timestamp".

| Clock | Meaning | Set by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider event time | The time the provider attaches to a tick, bar, quote, contract, or settlement. | Provider |
| Local receipt time | The time this process received the payload. | Ingestion |
| Engine decision time | The time a decision is stamped. It never precedes the provider event time of any input the decision used. In replay it is derived from the input stream, never from the wall clock. | Engine |
| Order dispatch time | The time execution handed an order to the broker transport. | Execution |
| Entry time | The contract start the broker confirmed. | Broker, recorded by execution |
| Due time | The contract expiry the broker confirmed. | Broker, recorded by execution |
| Settlement time | The time the outcome became final. | Broker or settlement rule, recorded by settlement |

Timestamps are Coordinated Universal Time with a declared precision. Durations carry explicit
units; a bare number is never a duration. A computation stamped at decision time `D` may read only
inputs whose provider event time is at or before `D`; in live operation the input must also have been
received. Replay and live operation apply the same rule through the same implementation.

## Ordering and provenance

Every ingested payload retains its source identity, the provider sequence when the provider supplies
one, a local receipt sequence that is monotonic per source, the parser and adapter version, and a
payload identity. Gaps, duplicates, stale data, reconnects, backpressure, and reconciliation are
recorded as explicit events with their clocks; none is silent, and none is repaired by fabrication.
Cross-source merges order by provider event time, then a configured stable source order, then a
canonical record order, so the merged sequence is reproducible.

## Instruments, ticks, and bars

`Tick` and `Bar` are distinct records. A source declares which of them it can provide. There is no
universal market event with optional fields, and no implicit conversion from bars to ticks. A
bar-only source cannot satisfy a request that needs a tick path, a tick count, an entry tick, or tick
settlement. An instrument is a neutral typed identifier bound to a broker, a provider symbol, and a
base and quote currency; the owning phase records its observed profile rather than assuming one.

## Currency and money

Currency, amount, price or tick, quantity, probability, payout, fee, foreign-exchange rate, side,
timestamp, and settlement values are distinct types. At money, order, accounting, and risk boundaries
an amount is a checked integer or decimal in a declared currency and scale; binary floating point is
allowed only inside feature, model, and device computation. Rounding rules, conversion ownership,
the foreign-exchange source and its freshness, the reporting currency, and exposure aggregation are
declared explicitly by the phase that introduces them. A payout is a property of one quoted contract
at one time; the system never keeps a global remembered payout.

## Artifacts

Artifacts are immutable and identified by content. Google Cloud Storage owns bulk data and
artifacts; Supabase stores references and proved transactional or metadata needs, never duplicate
bulk or execution truth. Every artifact records its schema version, the producing code revision, the
resolved configuration hash, and the identities of its inputs. A completed evidence identity is never
overwritten.

## Dataset roles

A dataset generation carries exactly one role: development, evaluation, or holdout. Development and
evaluation feed research. Holdout is one-way: its objects, metrics, artifacts, credentials,
observations, pass or fail detail, and retries cannot influence features, tuning, ranking, stopping,
defaults, or another research iteration. Candidate and configuration identity freeze before terminal
certification.

## Strategy

Strategies and models emit typed intent. Only execution communicates with a broker. One causal
ingestion, data, and feature implementation and one chronological execution, settlement, accounting,
and risk implementation serve development, evaluation, optimization, certification, replay, and live
operation. Mode adapters change capabilities and input or output, never core semantics.

## Settlement and order state

An order is in exactly one of: not sent, sent, acknowledged, accepted, rejected, partially filled or
open, possibly sent, settled, or reconciled. A submission in the unknown or possibly-sent state is
never retried before reconciliation. Settlement uses the confirmed entry and due times and the
declared settlement rule; a tie is settled by the rule, never assumed.

## Holdout

Locked holdout data, its access grants, and its certification results are protected state. Research
success, certification, merge, deployment, paper operation, and live operation are distinct states
with distinct authorizations; none implies the next.

## Configuration

The configuration document is TOML. The engine package owns its meaning, validation, canonical form,
and content hash; the application package owns reading it from a path.

### Schema version 1

| Field | Type | Accepted values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | integer | `1` |
| `run_mode` | string | `research`, `replay`, `paper`, `live` |

Both fields are required. Any other field is rejected as unknown, so a raw secret value has no place
to live: credentials are always references that the application resolves outside the document. Each
later phase adds the fields it implements to this table.

### Run modes

A run mode selects capabilities and input or output, never semantics. `research` runs development,
evaluation, optimization, and, under a separate operator grant, locked-holdout certification;
`replay` drives the live runtime from a recorded event log without broker mutation; `paper` runs the
live path without real orders; `live` places real orders under its own authorization. The current
checkout validates the value and executes no mode.

### Canonical form

The canonical document serializes the validated configuration with keys in the schema-table order,
one key per line, standard TOML formatting, double-quoted strings, no comments, and a trailing
newline. Two documents with the same values have the same canonical form regardless of key order,
whitespace, or comments.

### Content hash, version 1

The content hash is SHA-256 over the bytes `binary-alpha config hash v1`, one line feed, and the
canonical document. It is rendered as `v1:sha256:` followed by sixty-four lowercase hexadecimal
digits. Any change to the hash input or to the canonical form increments the version prefix.

### Validation output

`binary-alpha config validate --config PATH` writes to standard output the line
`# content-hash: v1:sha256:...` terminated by a line feed, then the canonical document, and exits
with status 0. It writes nothing else and mutates nothing. On failure it writes one field-specific error with the line
and column to standard error and exits with status 1. Validating the canonical output again yields
the same canonical document and hash.
